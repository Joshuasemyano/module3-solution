                  The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of chicken essence, specifically on mental fatigue, by means of our established mental fatigue-inducing task and evaluation methods. Although the association between chicken essence and fatigue caused by mental workload has been indicated previously [14], that study design was totally different from ours in that it only compared chicken essence and placebo intake conditions administered for 7 days with an intra-subject design. To scientifically evaluate the anti-fatigue effect of chicken essence, we designed and conducted a placebo-controlled crossover study and evaluation sessions were performed just before and after the fatigue-inducing and rest sessions. Evaluation sessions included cognitive task trials to assess selective attention because our previous study showed that mental fatigue specifically caused a decrease in the ability to maintain selective attention .

                  Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.Beef is a source of protein and nutrients.Most beef can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc., while other cuts are processed corned beef or beef jerky. Trimmings, on the other hand, which are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner therefore tougher cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease, the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters. Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is,[3] but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows calves is called veal.

              <p>
                  Sushi is said to have originated in China between the 5th and the 3rd centuries BC, as a means of preserving fish in salt. Narezushi, the original form of sushi, has been made in South East Asia for centuries, and nowadays, there are still traces of it in some parts. Narezushi appeared in Japan in the 8th century, and still survives today in the form of foods such as carp sushi. Narezushi was primarily a means of food preservation, and each Japanese region developed its own version. In those days sushi was eaten during feast days and festivals, and was also an integral part of the celebration. Generally speaking, narezushi was made of rice and fish pickled together, mixed with rice vinegar and sake, laid under a large stone to prevent decay and left to ferment. However, the rice was used primarily to encourage fermentation, and was discarded so that only the fish was eaten..
